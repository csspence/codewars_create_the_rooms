/*
Escape the room
You are creating an "Escape the room" game. The first step is to create a hash table called rooms that contains all of the rooms of the game. 
There should be at least 3 rooms inside it, each being a hash table with at least three properties (e.g. name, description, completed).
*/

// Add rooms here
var rooms = {
  1: {name: 'A', description: 'Red', completed: true},
  2: {name: 'B', description: 'Blue', completed: true},
  3: {name: 'C', description: 'Yellow', completed: false}
}
